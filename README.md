# Online-Bus-Booking-Website
This is an interactive website, which we believe achieves our goal of making the booking, ticket selection, and verification of tickets an easy, hassle-free, and most importantly,
online operation. The Airport-City Bus Management System, as we refer to it, is made up of two websites: one for users and one for administrators. Each of the website has 
different pages and UI appropriately designed.

User site consists of various functionalities such as logging in, logging out, viewing profile, knowing the routes available to travel and finally the important one, booking tickets online with hasle-free transactions. This site also provides E-ticket to the user once the booking is made.
On the other hand, Admin site is used by admins to access the main website and make the necessary changes if required. Admin can also approve and deny bookings made using the user site. 

Coming to the implementation, our website, just like most others, is divided into three sections: 
the front-end, the server, and the back-end.
The front-end is primarily made up of HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS3 for the majority of the 
styling. MySQL is used for the backend (technically MariaDB, 100 percent compatible with 
MySQL). This website is currently hosted on an apache server that was created with XAMPP, a 
cross-platform web server solution. PHP is used to access the database from the website.
